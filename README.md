## Summary
A college budget is no joke, especially when you'e a freshman living in the dorms, like Jeff here. Jeff is currently attending the University of Texas at San Antonio and is confined to a tiny dorm room with no toaster, a little mini fridge that barely works, and a microwave thatâ€™s older than his parents. Jeff often wonders, "How can I stretch my $20 dollars to next week?" 

The Project 3: Feed Jeff Team decided to create a prototype website to help Jeff sruvive on his limited budget! Our initial website is strictly a way of measuring different prices of the most essential items for every students' diet: <b> Ramen </b>, <b> Pizza </b>, and <b> Mac and Cheese </b>. This prototype is currently only designed to handle two different store databases: <b> Walmart </b> located at 11210 Potranco Rd, San Antonio, TX 78253 and <b> WholeFoods </b> located at (INSERT ADDRESS HERE). We are in very heated debates with other stores that all currently in a bidding war to use our website and boost their business.

<h1 align="center"> Methodology </h1>

## Data Collection
We started with a scrape of the Walmart and WholeFoods databases. After scraping for our desired food items we ended up with 206 items for Jeff to choose from. We then took the data from the different websites and gathered them into an SQLite database. We split the columns using <b> Brand </b>, <b> Name </b>, <b> Price </b> , <b> Type </b>, and <b> Store </b> so that Jeff would be able to specifically choose which products he'd like to see.

## Creating Visualizations
After initializing a Flask-powered API, we used Heroku to deploy the webpage to the cloud so that Jeff would be able to use the prototype product as soon as possible. Project: Feed Jeff decided to use a combination of plotly and charts.js to create the visualizations on the webpage. Our team believe that utilizing these two libraries in combination would be the best way at achieving the most effective visualizations for Jeff to make his selections. 

## Limitations 
* Unable to scrape more websites due to:
  * Time Constraints 
  * Robot wall that protected against scraping 
  * API's had payment or authority requirements

## Future Goals 
* Project: Feed Jeff has several ideas in order to improve Jeff's culinary experience: 
  * Add more options for stores and foods
  * Add nutritional value of products
  * Create a Machine Learning Enviroment in order to better log Jeff's choices and provide suggestions
